# Tiny13 Firefles #

- 6 led fireflies using charlieplexing and bit angle modulation.
- leds are wired to PB0-PB2
- could easily be scaled to 14 with 1 extra pin and almost no code changes
- 0.25 mA power consumption on a 3V CR2032

## TODO

- watchdog for even deeper sleep duting dim phase
- button for toggling power(manual deep sleep)
- reduce parasitic flickering on powered down leds
